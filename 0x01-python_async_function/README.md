0x01. Python - Async
Overview

This project delves into the realm of asynchronous programming in Python. Led by Emmanuel Turlay, a Staff Software Engineer at Cruise, the project aims to enhance your understanding of async and await syntax, executing async programs with asyncio, running concurrent coroutines, creating asyncio tasks, and utilizing the random module.

Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

    async and await syntax
    How to execute an async program with asyncio
    How to run concurrent coroutines
    How to create asyncio tasks
    How to use the random module

Requirements
General

    A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
    All your files should end with a new line
    All your files must be executable
    The length of your files will be tested using wc
    The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
    Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x)
    All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
    All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
    All your functions should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')
    A documentation is not a simple word, itâ€™s a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified)

Tasks
Task 0: The basics of async
Task 1: Let's execute multiple coroutines at the same time with async
Task 2: Measure the runtime
Task 3: Tasks
Task 4: Tasks
