# 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations
### Overview

This project focuses on understanding and implementing variable annotations in Python. The tasks involve writing type-annotated functions, defining and annotating variables, and working with complex types. The primary goal is to grasp the concepts of type annotations in Python 3, how to use them to specify function signatures and variable types, and how to validate code using tools like mypy.
### Resources
#### [Python 3 typing documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
#### [MyPy cheat sheet](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cheat_sheet_py3.html)
### Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you should be able to:

    Explain type annotations in Python 3.
    Use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types.
    Understand duck typing.
    Validate Python code using mypy.

### Requirements
#### General

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
    All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7.
    All your files should end with a new line.
    The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3.
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
    Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5).
    All your files must be executable.
    The length of your files will be tested using wc.
    All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)').
    All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)').
    All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)').
    A documentation is not a simple word; it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified).
